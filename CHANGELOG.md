* Automatically detect encoding of CSV files when byte-order-mark (BOM) is present.
* Extend "json-path" option to support importing GeoJSON and TopoJSON data that is nested inside a larger JSON object.

v0.5.7
* Added "rewind" flag to the -clean command. This option fixes winding-order errors by converting holes that are outside of any ring into space-enclosing rings, and rings that are nested directly inside of other rings into donut holes.

v0.5.6
* Default GeoJSON output now complies with RFC 7946 with respect to polygon winding order and antimeridian-crossing bounding boxes. This means that space-enclosing rings are CCW and holes are CW. This is the opposite of how mapshaper used to output polygon rings without the rfc7946 flag.
* Added a gj2008 flag to the output command (-o gj2008). This flag maintains compatibility with the way Mapshaper used to output GeoJSON: CW rings, CCW holes, and bbox arrays that are always [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax].
* The old rfc7946 flag is no longer useful, but is retained for backwards compatibility. This flag (as before) truncates coordinates to 6 decimal places. Now, using this flag is equivalent to adding precision=0.000001 to the output command.

v0.5.5
* Prompt the user before closing the browser tab, if data has changed since the session began or since the last export.
* Include interactive data edits in the web ui console's "history" output.

v0.4.150
* Fixed a bug affecting the calc=[expression] option when performing polygon-to-polygon spatial joins.

v0.4.149
* Improve OGC Simple Features compliance of cleaned polygons.

v0.4.148
* Added sliver-control=[0-1] option to -clean -dissolve2 and -filter-slivers commands, for variable sliver control.
* Made sliver-control=1 the default value for these commands.
* Tweaked the default area threshold for gap/sliver removal to use a larger threshold for more detailed datasets (detail is estimated using average segments per ring).
* Changed name of min-gap-area option to gap-fill-area (original name also works).
* Added tests of -clean command polygon output to verify OGC Simple Features compatibility.

v0.4.147

* "-proj" command no longer throws an error if one or more coordinates fail to project. Instead, the points or arcs containing projection errors are removed.
* Added an npm "prepare" script for users who are installing mapshaper from source code.
* Added an "npm run build" script

v0.4.126
* The -simplify command now ignores datasets containing no paths instead of stopping with an error. This is useful in scripts, when clipping creates an empty layer.

* Added layer names to tab completion in the web UI console.

v0.4.113
* Fix for issue #339 (no .prj output after projecting to +proj=stere)

* Now the -points command auto-detects commonly used names for x and y coordinates (e.g. longitude,latitude,lon,lng,lat,x,y) when converting tabular data to points. It is no longer necessary to add x= and y= parameters to the -points command.

v0.4.107
* Preliminary work on new -symbols command.

v0.4.106
* Automatic DMS parsing in -points x= y=.
* Added a reference to the target record to -join where= expressions, named "target".

* [cli] Improved error message when trying to read unsupported file types.

v0.4.104
* Added "-uniq invert" option, for retaining non-unique records (useful e.g. for troubleshooting many-to-one joins).
* Improved some error messages.

v0.4.103
* Added "weighted" option to the "-filter-slivers" command. When used with the "min-area=" option, the "weighted" flag multiplies the area of each polygon ring by the "Polsby-Popper" compactness metric, so sliver-shaped rings have a lower effective area.
* Added "this.perimeter" to the JS expression context. Perimeter values are in meters for unprojected data or in projected units (usually meters) for projected data.
* Added "this.compactness" to the JS expression context. Compactness is the "Polsby-Popper" score of each polygon feature.
* Added "-points vertices2" option, which is like "-points vertices", but retains every vertex of the original polygon or polyline instead of removing duplicate vertices within each feature.
* Fix for issue #310.

v0.4.102
* Close issues #308 and #309.

v0.4.101

v0.4.84
* [rectangle] offset= option accepts a list of four values (minx,miny,maxx,maxy) in addition to a single value. Value can be a percentage or an interval.
* [rectangle] If no source= or bbox= option is given, -rectangle uses the bounding box of the current target layer(s).
* [points] Added a polyline-to-point conversion that reduces each polyline feature to a single vertex, suitable for point-in-polygon testing.
* Bug fixes

v0.4.83
* Now you can turn on multiple reference layers from the layers menu in the web UI. Reference layers are styled on the map if they have style attributes.
* If a feature is pinned via the [i] inspector tool, the delete key will delete it.
* The text-anchor property of single-line SVG labels is automatically updated on drag, based on its horizontal position in relation to its anchor point. Labels towards the left of the anchor are given text-anchor=end, labels to the right are given text-anchor=start and centered labels are given text-anchor=middle.
* The text-anchor property of multi-line SVG labels can be toggled by clicking the label after it has been selected.
* Added -uniq max-count= option to retain multiple features with the same id.

v0.4.82
* Added -lines each= option, for applying a JS expression to each output line feature. The expression can access data about the original polygon features, just like the where= option.

v0.4.81
* Added -lines where= and -innerlines where= options, for filtering lines using properties of adjacent polygons. Polygons are represented as A and B objects in the expression. B is null for "outer" lines.

v0.4.80
* Results of assigments in -calc expressions are available to subsequent -each expressions as variables.
* Updated dependencies.

v0.4.79
* Added new -include command for loading JS data and functions from an external file. The file should contain a single JS object. The keys and values of this object are converted to variables in the JS expression used by -each.

v0.4.78
* Bug fix

v0.4.77
* Added -s/--direct-save option to mapshaper-gui, for saving output files to a path relative to the user's current working directory, instead of into the browser's download folder.
* Added -f/--force-save option to mapshaper-gui, to allow overwriting input files.

v0.4.70
* Order of data fields is preserved in DBF output (previously fields were sorted in case-sensitive ascending order).

v0.4.69
* Added support for using .shx file when present. (Very occasionally, records in the .shp file are packed in an unusual way, and the .shx index file is needed for reading the .shp file).

v0.4.68
* Added ability to dismiss the intersection display on the GUI.
* Updated web interface colors.

v0.4.67
* Renamed -svg-style command to -style (-svg-style still works as an alias).
